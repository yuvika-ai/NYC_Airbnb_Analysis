# NYC_Airbnb_Analysis
Exploring NYC Airbnb data through neighborhood-level price analysis, reviews, and availability, with interactive maps and visualizations. Feature engineering and AI/ML prediction models are in progress.
# NYC Airbnb Data Analysis 🏙️

This is a portfolio project where I analyze the **New York City Airbnb dataset** to explore patterns in pricing, locations, and other features.  
The goal is to understand relationships in the dataset and eventually build a **predictive model** for Airbnb pricing.

## 📌 Project Steps

1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
   - Loaded dataset with Pandas
   - Handled missing values and outliers

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Explored host, room, and neighborhood trends
   - Analyzed price distributions
   - Studied correlations between features

3. **Visualizations**
   - Price-location relationships
   - Choropleth map of prices across NYC neighborhoods (Folium)
   - Seaborn & Matplotlib visualizations

4. **Feature Engineering & ML (In Progress)**
   - Creating new features for better predictions
   - Building ML model for price prediction (Scikit-learn)

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium  
- Scikit-learn (for predictive modeling)  
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  

---

## 🔮 Next Steps
- Add feature engineering  
- Train predictive ML model  
- Evaluate performance (RMSE, MAE, R²)
